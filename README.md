Well well well...

Now that you are here, there are 2 options.
1 - You were curious and checked my github profile
2 - Since I use VSC you thought I synced my files with github

If your option is 1, have a nice day and thanks for checking out my profile.

However if your option is 2, I think thats very pathetic, did you really think I would sync my game files and leave them right in the open?
Im not stupid buddy, better luck next time sadly :(
